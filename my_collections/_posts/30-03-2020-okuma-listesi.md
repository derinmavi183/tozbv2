Reading for pleasure is always been a minority occupation. 

Most people don't read for pleasure.

Of the people read for pleasure only small porportion by books. 

Of the people buy books only small porportion buy difficult books. 

Its a speciality market. I don't think that is changing.

Book is a depth think and rethink deeper in and any other medium.

If you can really read you can read faster than you can listen.

Podcast dinlemek ve Youtube videoları da faydalı. You can make another things when you doing it.

## Dostoyevski - Yeraltından Notlar

Most revolationary work. 

A major theme throughout the novel is man's intensified sense of self which, Dostoyevsky believes, is his greatest strength and, also his prominent weakness.
Roman boyunca ana tema, Dostoyevski'nin en büyük gücü ve aynı zamanda göze çarpan zayıflığı olduğuna inandığı insanın yoğun kendilik duygusu.
