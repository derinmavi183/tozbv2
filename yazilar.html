  <h6 class="docs-header">Is Skeleton for you?</h6>
  <p>You should use Skeleton if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks. Skeleton only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started. In fact, <u>this site is built on Skeleton and has ~200 lines of custom CSS</u> (half of which is the docking navigation).</p>
  <p>Love Skeleton and want to Tweet it, share it, or star it? Well, I appreciate that &lt;3</p>
