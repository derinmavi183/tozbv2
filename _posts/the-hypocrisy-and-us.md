## Us And The Hypocrisy
We were on the road to Antalya. 
Both of my friends were very political types who had studied in Marmara. This is what happens to those who study in the social sections.
The girl said there is no left and right anymore.
And something about the power plants. 
I thought of what my chemistry teacher said in high school. Those big chimneys only give off steam. Nuclear facilities are actually not that harmful to the environment.
We said lets change the topic. We didnt talked about politics.

It caught my attention that she had a master's degree. She worked in something related to printing. Editorial work for a small publisher. Publisher was not good. Didnt pay to her.

The other one. She was in to girls I guess. But she looked differently. She was different like a unicorn. 
I liked it. She said she was a researcher. When we first met she acted like an old woman. This was the trick of course.

I have come to this age and all my observations show that the Turkish left is hypocritical.
They screwed up bad. They screwed up badly.
Some of them completely lunatics and some of them are stupid and some of them knows what they do.
But that is not good.

When you want something to not be made somnetimes you make a imitation of it. In that way you can manage the situation right?

I thing the true power balance of the world still exists among nation-states. Everything else is affected by it.
There is a real left. This is a little different from left american progressive wokes, but even these wokes are meaningful because they point to the real problem of racism and real class exploitation or discrimination against other small groups.

In Turkey, the fight is so separate that ideologies become completely meaningless. Sometimes it really resembles a tribal fight. These are just angry people who want to hurt the other. Ideologies are just tools in this manner. People can take serious damage from this. This is an occasion. These people strangely feed off of chaos.
