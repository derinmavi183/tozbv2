The name. I mean name of this text comes from a song.
Name of the song is turks are restless. Actiually math rock. When you say you are listening math rock it is like you are smart isnt it.
Buts lets come to topic. Turks were restless right? Arabistanlı Lavrence'ın ve daha nicelerinin çabaları savaşlar sonucu Osmanlı yıkılmıştı.
Bu haberler avrupaya ve amerikaya ulaşıyor olmalıydı. İttihat ve Terakki was the name of the game. Enverdeki cesarete bak. Baskınla padişahı tahttan indirmek.
Yabancılar bu haberleri dinliyordu ajan olduklarından ve padişah karşıtı olduklarından olduğunu sanmıyorum. Belki de ne olacak diye merak ediyorlardı yalnızca.

İngiliz ajan geleneği yaygındır. Ünlü bir adam da var. 
Hala bir ajan filminden bahsedilse türklerin adı geçer. İstanbul kim bilir ne kadar süredir bir ajan cennetidir.

I only did 20 days of military service. But overall I like it.
In fact, I made a joke like that, they really loaded subliminal messages inside me all these years, I guess it was revealed at my age. 
Because everything related to the military interests me. 
I did this small service at Ardahan. Border between . Because you know you have only 20 days it passes so quick.
Of course there is some trouble. Vast differences between people. ı saw the bubble im in and dark side of uneducated people.
Also bright sides of people. Like there was a guy which he was from ardahan. Weird looking type. He was talking with a girl on phone. Mountain people
the way he used language. SOme people smart people. Like one engineer. We actually had 2 doctors in that 50 people. 

When you know your days are limited. It passes quick. But even it can be detremental sometimes. But also good sides. 

Second world war, dictators like hitler and stalin, ottoman heritage, abdulhamit and ittihadists.

Compared to my older friends, I can say that I am happy to be Turkish.
I am even at peace with the concept of Turkish patriotism and the military.
Over the years, as some have said, it has become a crime to be a Turk in this country.
Indeed, such an atmosphere is created, this sentence is an indication of this.

Top level foreign cultural intelligence operation. Most of people cant like military. 

It was interesting that the address to the youth was removed. 
Our oath has been lifted. I was beaten for being disrespectful while I was reading our oath. 
But I was not offended by our oath. I didn't even know it had such a meaning. 
After that, I did not find this meaning strange. 
But some people were uncomfortable with this oath. It was irrational for me to even understand that.

Of course, the military is very difficult. It is so difficult that it would be impossible for an outsider to understand. 
It can crush and change people. In some places, it can raise or lower the personality. 
Such were the heroes of the liberation war, especially Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. 
They were in the elite officer rank of a collapsing empire.

I never gave a vote to something other than CHP.
Erdogans . He gets old his ideas too. And economy too. He says because of his attatude but
isnt it your job? You should balance that. That is the thing.
