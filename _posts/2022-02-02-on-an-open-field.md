Till Lindemann, a member of the Rammstein music group has a side project called [Lindemann](), which he founded in collaboration with Peter Tägtgren. [Steh Auf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOjK992bPU) is one of the most successful tracks on the band’s F&M album in 2019. The song has a striking video clip. Steh Auf means wake up. Although the depressing lyrics of the song are written as a call of a child to a drug-addicted mother, the song in contrast extremely lively for the listener. The perspective and the visuals used by the clip's director Zoran Bihać makes the clip even more filled up with energy.

In Lindemann's Steh Auf, clip looks like it has been taken from a dream sequence. As the audience, we see this whole situation through the eyes of the lethargic and blocked. Wake up! The sleep, the state of heedlessness that the song cries out, is described as a psychological blur. The grotesque appearances of actors Peter Stormare and Till Lindemann make it difficult for the audience to empathize, while their shabby, unimportant situation creates a tragicomic atmosphere. When an Asian woman on a horse breaks down the wall and kidnaps Lindemann after drug use and mental problems, it makes the story funnier and even more dramatic by ending the suffering of the character in an alienated way. Reminiscent of China, in tune with the danger from the east, the attack to three white men by an Asian woman blends concerning the spirit of our time.

Here we are in a timeless loop where we see the dream of the past, the conqueror of the steps. The part of the clip where the horsemen came was shot on the steppes of Kazakhstan. Here, anachronism acts as a method of art. The image that comes to our eyes, it can be interpreted as a reference to the Mongolian invasion, commemoration to one of the painful memories of humanity. Led at first by Genghis Khan, the empire lasted from 1206 until 1368. During that time, empire expanded to cover most of Europa and Asia, with enormous horde of nomadic wariors. As a result, Mongolian raids killed 60 million people by even [changing the carbon footprint of humanity](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/genghis-khan-eco-warrior) on the planet. It reduced word population by 11% at that time. 16 million people around the world today are considered to be 0.5%, direct descendants of Genghis Khan. It is not known whether it has affected our collective subconscious or not the figures show that today it is hard to think human history without the trace of the Mongolian invasion. The clip finds this image intuitively.

The distant remainder of a Mongolian rider on an open field - this great trauma of history - becomes the refreshing solution that the flow of life has founded to bring end to the unfunctional and the blocked. Erases or wakes it up!
