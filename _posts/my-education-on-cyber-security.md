## My Education on Cyber Security

Last year I attnded to masters program in Bahcesehir university Istanbul.
The program is called Cyber Security which can actually be called a sub-branch of Information Security.
Cyber Security focuses on ensuring the security of computer systems. The increasing importance of cyber security has been effective in choosing this department.
Hear are the notes from the field.

1. A Private University?

Private universities in Turkey is a controversial issue in terms of the quality of education.
Education was generally good and benefical. Bahcesehir University has a lot of international student.
Only 5 Turkish students in my term. Foreigner made a International Day. These was on the news.
One of My friend was worried about these photo takers and they are from Pakistan. Because my friend is Pakistan.
While all this was going on, it was a difficult year for the Turkish economy.
He was worried that tensions would rise towards the election.
A raise to the minimum wage.
This situation of going abroad has affected the IT sector in Turkey. We also heard it from our teachers.
